# OOP-Workshops
## Citation and Sources 
In all the DIY part of your workshops, a file called **sources.txt** must be present. This file will be submitted with your work automatically.<br />   
You are to write either of the following statements in the file "sources.txt":<br /><br />
"I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments."<br />
Then add your name and your student number"<br /><br />
OR:<br /><br />
Write exactly which part of the code of the workshops or the assignment are given to you as help and who gave it to you or which source you received it from. <br />
You need to mention the workshop name or assignment name and also the file name and the parts in which you received the code for help.<br />
Finally add your name and student number at the bottum.<br /><br />
By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing.
